  <li>¼ cup Thai green curry paste</li>
  <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
  <li>1 (1/4 inch thick) slice ginger, finely grated</li>

  <li>1 (8 ounce) can bamboo shoots, drained</li>

  <li>¼ cup thinly sliced Thai basil, or more to taste</li>

<h3>Directions</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Heat oil in a wok until it starts to shimmer. Add curry paste, garlic,
  and ginger; stir together and fry until fragrant, 2 to 3<br> minutes. Add
  chicken breast slices, stirring until coated. Cook until just slightly
  pink in the center, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
  <br>

  <li>While chicken is cooking, place baby corn and bamboo shots in a small
  saucepan, cover with water, and place over high<br> heat. Bring to a boil.
  Drain then cover with water again.</li>
  <br>

  <li>Pour coconut milk into the wok. Bring to a slow simmer, stirring occasionally,
  about 5 minutes. Drain corn and bamboo<br> shoots and add in. Stir in fish sauce,
  palm sugar, and lime leaves. Bring back up to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes.
  Stir<br> in bell pepper strips and cook until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes.</li>
  <br>

  <li>Remove curry from heat and stir in Thai basil.</li>
</ol>
